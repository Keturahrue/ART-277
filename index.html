  	<h1>Interest rate</h1>
	<p><strong>An interest rate is the amount of interest due per period, as a proportion of the amount lent, deposited, or borrowed (called the principal sum). The total interest on an amount lent or borrowed depends on the principal sum, the interest rate, the compounding frequency, and the length of time over which it is lent, deposited, or borrowed.
The interest rate is deﬁned as the proportion of an amount loaned which a lender charges as interest to the borrower, normally expressed as an annual percentage.[1] It is the rate a bank or other lender charges to borrow its money, or the rate a bank pays its savers for keeping money in an account.[2]
The annual interest rate is the rate over a period of one year.</strong> Other interest rates apply over different periods, such as a month or a day, but they are usually annualized.
The interest rate has been characterized as "an index of the preference for a dollar of present [income] over a dollar of future income."[3] The borrower wants, or needs, to have money sooner rather than later, and is willing to pay a fee—the interest rate—for that privilege.

	<h2>Monetary policy</h2>
	<p><b><u>monetary policy and are taken into account when dealing with variables like investment, inﬂation, and unemployment. The central banks of countries generally tend to reduce interest rates when they wish to increase investment and consumption in the country's economy. However, a low interest rate as a macroeconomic policy can be risky and may lead to the creation of an economic bubble, in which large amounts of investments are poured into the realestate market and stock market. In developed economies, interest-rate
adjustments are thus made to keep inﬂation within a target range for the health of economic activities or cap the interest rate concurrently with economic growth to safeguard economic momentum.</b></u>

<p>Higher <u>interest rates</u> increase the cost of borrowing which can reduce physical investment and output and increase unemployment. Higher rates encourage more saving and reduce inﬂation.

The Federal Reserve <b>(often referred to as 'the Fed')</b> implements monetary policy largely by targeting the federal funds rate. This is the rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans of federal funds, which are the reserves held by banks at the Fed. Open market operations are one tool within monetary policy implemented by the Federal Reserve to steer short-term interest rates using the power to buy and sell treasury securities.

Money and inﬂation
Loans, bonds, and shares have some of the characteristics of money and are included in the broad money supply.
By setting i*n, the government institution can affect the markets to alter the total of loans, bonds and shares issued. Generally speaking, a higher real interest rate reduces the broad money supply.
Through the quantity theory of money, increases in the money supply lead to inﬂation.

<h4>Zero rate policy</h4>
<p>A so-called "zero interest-rate policy" (ZIRP) is a very low—near-zero—central bank target interest rate. At this zero lower bound the central bank faces diﬃculties with conventional monetary policy, because it is generally believed that market interest rates cannot realistically be pushed down into negative territory.
<i>Nominal interest rates are normally positive, but not always. In contrast, real interest rates can be negative, when
Negative nominal or real rates</i>
nominal interest rates are below inﬂation. When this is done via government policy (for example, via reserve requirements), this is deemed ﬁnancial repression, and was practiced by countries such as the United States and United Kingdom following World War II (from 1945) until the late 1970s or early 1980s (during and following the Post–World War II economic expansion).[21][22] In the late 1970s, United States Treasury securities with negative real interest rates were deemed certiﬁcates of conﬁscation.[23]

<h5>Theory</h5>
<p>Given the alternative of holding cash, and thus earning 0%, rather than lending it out, proﬁt-seeking lenders will not lend below 0%, as that will guarantee a loss, and a bank offering a negative deposit rate will ﬁnd few takers, as savers will instead hold cash.[24]
Negative interest rates have been proposed in the past, notably in the late
…
19th century by Silvio Gesell.<i> A negative interest rate can be described</i> (as by Gesell) as a "tax on holding money"; he proposed it as the Freigeld (free money) component of his Freiwirtschaft (free economy) system. To prevent people from holding cash (and thus earning 0%), Gesell suggested issuing money for a limited duration, after which it must be exchanged for new bills; attempts to hold money thus result in it expiring and becoming worthless. Along similar lines, John Maynard Keynes approvingly cited the idea of a carrying tax on money,[25] (1936, The
General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money) but dismissed it due to administrative diﬃculties. More recently, a carry tax on currency was proposed by a Federal Reserve employee (Marvin Goodfriend) in 1999, to be implemented via magnetic strips on bills, deducting the carry tax upon deposit, the tax being based on how long the bill had been held.[26]

Financial economists such as World Pensions Council (WPC) researchers have argued that durably low interest rates in most G20 countries will have an adverse impact on the funding positions of pension funds as “without returns that outstrip inﬂation, pension investors face the real value of their savings declining rather than ratcheting up over the next few years” [20]
From 1982 until 2012, most Western economies experienced a period of low
